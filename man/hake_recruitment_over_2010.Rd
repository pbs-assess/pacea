\title{Pacific Hake annual age-0 recruitments divided by recruitments in 2010, as estimated by the 2023 stock assessment.}
\format{
A tibble also of class `pacea_recruitment` with columns:
\describe{
  \item{year:}{year of the estimate of scaled recruitment}
  \item{low:}{low end (2.5th percentile) of the 95\% credible interval for
  the scaled recruitment, unitless}
  \item{median:}{median estimate of scaled recruitment, unitless}
  \item{high:}{high end (97.5th percentile) of the 95\% credible interval for
  the scaled recruitment, unitless}
 }

\description{
This is calculated to improve understanding when comparing recruitments
between years. A survey of participants in the stock assessment process
found that all but one respondent correctly inferred from the standard plot
`plot(hake_recruitment)` that the 2014 recruitment has zero probability of
being as large as the (well-known large) 2010 recruitment.
}
\details{
For each Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sample the recruitment in a year is
divided by the recruitment in 2010, and then median and credible intervals
are calculated for each year across all samples.

For more details see Appendix H of the 2022 assessment at
https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/2022-02/2022-hake-assessment-post-srg.pdf.
Figure 31 of the 2023 assessment shows the 2023 results.
