<!-- Versions:

pacea-talk.Rmd is the main one, got a bit fancy with switches for a long and
  short talk, so I made:
pacea-talk-sopo-25-update.Rmd for SOPO 25
 Using that as a template for:
pacea-talk-short.Rmd for FUTURE Habitat talk plus Molecular Genetics section
  meeting.
Suggest going forward with the long one and short one.
Note that results and figures are cached.

-->

<!-- To build:

load_all()      # as necessary, then

rmarkdown::render("pacea-talk-short.Rmd")

or click the knit button in RStudio

Note the first slide below creates the title slide (on page 2), from a
   powerpoint slide saved as .png.

See the long_talk = FALSE and other options in first chunk.

When talk is finished save the .pdf with a new name
(e.g. pacea-release-talk-dfo.pdf, pacea-release-talk-uvic.pdf) and commit the
.pdf, so we can just keep the single set of .Rmd code. Also link the pdf talk
from README.Rmd.
-->

<!-- trying different themes from https://mpetroff.net/files/beamer-theme-matrix/
theme:
Copenhagen - too much at bottom
Frankfurt - shows progress bar at top (play with colours though), nothing at bottom.
Luebeck - awful (lists sections vertically at the top)
metropolis - too many borders
Rochester - slide title is in top border, but that's really big
Singapore - used for hake, slide title does take up a bit of room, looks good with lily

colortheme:
dolphin - black top bar for Frankfurt
lily
orchid
