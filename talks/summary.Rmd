# Summary

## Commitments from package authors

We will:

- \tiny (try to) \normalsize not break the package, by working on branches on
  GitHub before merging.

- ensure any improvements are back compatible.

- update the NEWS as we add/update data and make improvements.

- update the following every two months as the raw data get updated:
