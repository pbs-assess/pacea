# Populations

## Zooplankton in the Strait of Georgia

- anomalies of zooplankton biomass since 1996 (Perry et al., 2021)

- extended by Kelly Young each year for SOPO; 25 species groups

```{r zooplot}
plot(zooplankton_sog)
```

## Pacific Herring biomass (five stocks)

New and updating annually from stock assessments (Cleary et al.):
```{r herringbiomassplot}
plot(herring_spawning_biomass,
     region = "HG")
```

## Pacific Harbour Seals

Estimated abundances for seven regions (and coastwide) were calculated by DFO
(2022; SAR 2022/034), and included here:
```{r sealplot}

     region = "HG")
