Presenting pacea: an R package of Pacific ecosystem information to help facilitate an
ecosystem approach to fisheries management.

Andrew Edwards

The leading cause of ecosystem information not being used in DFO stock assessments is
the availability of such information. Our pacea R package aims to overcome this
limitation by amalgamating disparate types of information in a single R package.
Released in November 2023, pacea currently includes:
 - 204,828 calculations of daily sea surface temperature based on data from 19
 buoys;
 - 27 years of monthly mean outputs from a spatial physical-biogeochemical
 model, for 40,580 spatial cells, including pH, salinity, temperature,
 phytoplankton, and primary production.
 - 42 years of spatial values from NOAA’s spatial Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) record, that incorporates observations from different platforms (satellites, ships, buoys, and Argo floats);
- 9 climatic and oceanographic indices, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and those related to El Niño;
- estimates of abundances for Harbour Seals and Pacific Hake;
- zooplankton biomass anomalies for 25 species groups, from 1996 onwards.
The package includes many helper and plotting functions with full documentation
and references. This talk will demonstrate the package, and also explain some of
the features that may be of interest to colleagues from other regions who might
consider building a similar package; pacea itself was originally motivated by
the gslea package for the Gulf of St Lawrence.

pacea: an R package of Pacific ecosystem information to help facilitate an
ecosystem approach to fisheries management.

- DFO is moving towards an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management.
- The leading cause of ecosystem information not being used in DFO stock assessments is
the availability of such information.
- Our pacea package is overcoming this limitation by amalgamating disparate
types of information (e.g. outputs from oceanographic models, temperatures from
buoys, zooplankton biomass anomalies), together with plotting and analytical
functions.
- Package authors are from StAR, OSD, and ESD.
