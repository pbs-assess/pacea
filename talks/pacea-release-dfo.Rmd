<!-- To build either run
   rmarkdown::render("pacea-release-dfo.Rmd")
 or click the knit button in RStudio -->

<!-- trying different themes from https://mpetroff.net/files/beamer-theme-matrix/
theme:
Copenhagen - too much at bottom
Frankfurt - shows progress bar at top (play with colours though), nothing at bottom.
Luebeck - awful (lists sections vertically at the top)
metropolis - too many borders
Rochester - slide title is in top border, but that's really big
Singapore - used for hake, slide title does take up a bit of room, looks good with lily

colortheme:
dolphin - black top bar for Frankfurt
lily
orchid
