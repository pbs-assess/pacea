# Summary

## Current uses of pacea (that we know about)

 - Spiny Dogfish: understanding declines over the past 20 years

 - shrimp: impact of including environmental variables on predicting distributions

 - humpback whales and porpoises: environmental covariates in species distribution models

 - Pacific Saury assessment: finding links between two basin-scale indices and process errors, directly supporting Canada's North Pacific Fisheries
   Commission commitments

 - Petrale Sole stock assessment

 - State of the Pacific Ocean meeting Mar 2024
