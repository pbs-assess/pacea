# Summary

## Current uses of pacea (that we know about)

 - Spiny Dogfish: understanding declines over the past 20 years

 - shrimp: impact of including environmental variables on predicting distributions

 - humpback whales and porpoises: environmental covariates in species distribution models

 - Pacific Saury assessment: finding links between two basin-scale indices and process errors, directly supporting Canada's North Pacific Fisheries
   Commission commitments

 - Petrale Sole stock assessment

 - State of the Pacific Ocean meeting Mar 2024

## Ecosystem summaries

Idea is to head towards stock-specific functions like (draft version):

```{r, ecosumplot, echo = FALSE}
# Before moving into R/
source(paste0(here::here(),
              "/R-temp/ecosystem-summary-hake.R"))
png(paste0(here::here(), "/talks/talks-manual-figures/ecosystem-summary-hake.png"),
    width = 670,   # 670 matches size from running from a chunk
    height = 480)
ecosystem_summary_hake()
dev.off()
```

```{r, ecosum, eval = FALSE}
ecosystem_summary_hake()
```
![](talks-manual-figures/ecosystem-summary-hake.png){width=40%}
