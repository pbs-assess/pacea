# Introduction


## Motivation

\centering pacea: An R package of Pacific ecosystem information to help facilitate an
ecosystem approach to fisheries management

\

- push to include ecosystem information in advice to fisheries managers

- leading impediment: availability of data and model output
  - where to find it, wrangling it (e.g netCDF into R), understanding it
  - Open Data is great, but have to convert raw data into
  `r colorize("usable information", "red")`

- primary audience is DFO stock assessment scientists, but usable by anyone
  (with a minimal working knowledge of R)


## Availability

- hosted free on GitHub at https://github.com/pbs-assess/pacea

- easy installation:

\

\centering \textcolor{red}{\texttt{remotes::install\_github("pbs-assess/pacea")}}

\

- all vignettes are rendered on GitHub for easy learning, custom plotting files,
  help for everything, fully open source

- all data (except oceanographic model output) is saved within the package
  - no further downloading required
  - not relying on external websites being functional

## `pacea` objects (climatic/oceanographic)

Currently, pacea contains (`r colorize("red is updated/new since last year's meeting", "red")`):

- $\cancel{204,039}$ `r colorize(format(nrow(buoy_sst), big.mark = ","), "red")` calculations of daily sea surface
   temperature based on data from `r nrow(buoy_metadata)` buoys

\pause

- outputs from the spatial British Columbia continental margin (BCCM) model,
   `r colorize("now expanded from just Canada's EEZ to include the full model domain,
   extending into US waters", "red")`

\pause

- `r colorize("outputs from the spatial Hindcast of the Salish Sea (HOTSSea)
  physical oceanography model (including Puget Sound), 1980-2018", "red")`

\pause

- NOAA's spatial Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) record
  `r colorize("updated monthly", "red")`

\pause

- $\cancel{9}$ `r colorize(nrow(pacea_indices), "red")` climatic and oceanographic indices, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and those related to El Ni√±o

## `pacea` objects (biological)

- estimates of abundances for Harbour Seals

- estimates of spawning stock biomass and annual recruitments for
 `r colorize("Pacific Hake", "red")` and `r colorize("Pacific Herring", "red")`

- `r colorize("zooplankton biomass anomalies in the Strait of Georgia for 25 species groups", "red")`
