Copy things from existing powerpoint.

## Guidelines for users

Read the README!!

Check the NEWS!!

We have built comprehensive vignettes and help files for each type of data object in `pacea`.

Please go through them as this will be how to really understand the details.

For any simple questions just contact us. For detailed questions or bug reports
please post an `Issue` on GitHub and a minimum working example:

 - often helps you figure out the answer
 - using `Issues` allow you to first check if we are already working on it
 - allows others to see (and maybe help answer) questions being asked

We will describe updates to `pacea` in the NEWS, such as updating certain data
sets and adding new ones.
