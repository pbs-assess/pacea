# Obtaining the oceanographic basin indices and compile them into pacea.
# Creating a consistent format of class pacea_index.

# To update - run through line-by-line. Some of the checks to do with checking
#  older values of an index with the newly-downloaded older values may fail,
#  because recent values may sometimes be tweaked. But test failing will force a
#  manual check.
# NEWS - update it with mention of updated data, and note if any historical
#  values have changed greatly.

# To add a new index - check the saved .txt files below to see which one
#  most closely matches the new one and use the code here as a
#  template (copy to near the end of this file).
#  If none match then congratulations, you have discovered yet another
#  format!
#  Add the new index to the  pacea_index object at the end of this file.

# Useful background:
#  http://www.o3d.org/npgo/        # Timed out on 10-06-2024, no time to dig
#  into. Did once on 6-08-2024 then worked the second time (had looked on
#  browser also, though doubt that mattered). Did download but looks like format
#  has changed: download file is just html. But 'Download Index' link from https://www.o3d.org/npgo/ has not
#  been updated since the latest already in pacea, though that isn't exactly
#  what we used. So something has changed, but don't worry now as looks like
#  data not updated anyway.
