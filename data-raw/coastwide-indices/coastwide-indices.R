# Obtaining the oceanographic basin indices and compile them into pacea.
# Creating a consistent format, of class pacea_index.

# To update - run through line-by-line. Some of the checks to do with checking
#  older values of an index with the newly-downloaded older values may fail,
#  because recent values may sometimes be tweaked. But test failing will force a
#  manual check - if historical values have changed greatly, this should be
#  mentioned in the NEWS.

# To add a new index - check the saved .txt files below to see which one
#  most closely matches the new one and use the code here as a
#  template (copy to near the end of this file).
#  If none match then congratulations, you have discovered yet another
#  format!
#  Add the new index to the  pacea_index object at the end of this file.

# Can prob delete: TODO
