Type	Operation schedule	Gauge type

Annual Hydrometric Remarks

WATER LEVEL NOT AVAILABLE 2023-12-28 TO 2024-01-08.

Note for historic data the "Symbol.Symbole" column was not defined, and we have
kept all values. A `summary()` gives:
 Symbol.Symbole
  :38828
 A:  523
 B:  822
 E:  675

i.e. 38828 with no symbol There were some symbols near the end of the time
series, so it's not just a historical thing.


`fraser_discharge_mean` and `fraser_discharge_max` represent, for each month, the mean daily discharge and the maximum daily discharge, respectively. Add units - m3/s.
